# Traffic Project

# Project Title
The Impacts of Weather on Traffic
# Project Description
The goal of this project will be to analyze and compare possible relationships between various quantitative and categorical weather factors and traffic volume. I will also be analyzing how whether the day is a holiday or not (a binary variable) and different days/times impact these weather variables. I expect to run various levels of regression analysis to predict traffic based upon certain weather factors. 

# Data Set Description
The data set contains 9 variables and 48205 unique observations over a 7 year span from 2012-2018. The data was gathered from the westbound I-94 route in Minneapolis-St Paul, Minnesota. The variables consist of whether that day was a holiday or not, the temperature, snow/rain levels, the percentage of cloud cover, and text descriptions of the weather, the date and time of the observation, and lastly the overall traffic volume.
